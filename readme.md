# 🤖 Fire Fighting Robot 🔥🚒

Welcome to the **Fire Fighting Robot** project! This Arduino-based robot is designed to detect and extinguish small fires autonomously using sensors and a water spray mechanism.

## 📌 Overview

This project was built during my free time as a hands-on experiment with **robotics**, **Arduino**, and **fire safety systems**. The robot uses flame detection to identify fire and moves toward it to put it out using a water pump mechanism.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🔥 **Fire Detection** using a flame sensor
- 💧 **Automatic Water Spray** with a servo-powered pump
- 🧭 **Basic Navigation** to move toward the fire
- ⚙️ **Arduino-Powered** for easy programming and flexibility

---

## 🧰 Components Used

- 🟦 Arduino UNO (or compatible board)
- 🔥 Flame Sensor (IR)
- 🛞 DC Motors + Motor Driver
- 💧 Water Pump
- 🌀 Servo Motor
- 🔋 Battery Pack
- 🧱 Robot Chassis

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. 🔍 The flame sensor detects fire by sensing infrared radiation.
2. 🚗 The robot navigates toward the detected flame.
3. 💦 Once close enough, it activates a water spray mechanism.
4. ✅ The fire is extinguished, and the robot resumes searching.

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. ⚙️ **Assemble** the robot frame and components.
2. 🔌 **Wire** everything according to the circuit diagram.
3. 💻 **Upload** the Arduino sketch using the Arduino IDE.
4. 🔋 **Power Up** the robot and test in a safe, controlled environment.
